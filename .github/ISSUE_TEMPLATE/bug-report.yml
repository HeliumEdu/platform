      Please we aware that Helium is free and is not under active development. Though [supporting the project financially](https://github.com/sponsors/alexdlaird) is appreciated (since Helium has operating costs, even though it is free to use), we make no guarantees bug reports will be looked at or considered.

      Though this project is not under active development, we are still happy to review pull requests submitted by the community to resolve bugs, so submitting a report of your experience may still be helpful to us and others.
